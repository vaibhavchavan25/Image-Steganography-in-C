Image Steganography in C

1. Introduction
Image Steganography is the technique of hiding secret information within a digital image so that the existence of the information is not easily detectable.
This project implements Image Steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique in C.

2. Objective
- Securely embed secret text inside an image
- Extract hidden messages accurately
- Understand LSB-based steganography
- Apply bitwise operations and file handling in C

3. Scope of the Project
- Academic and mini-project use
- Demonstrates low-level programming concepts
- Can be extended with encryption

4. Steganography Technique Used
Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique modifies the least significant bit of image bytes to store secret data.

5. Features
- Secure data hiding
- Minimal image distortion
- Command-line based execution
- Efficient memory usage

6. Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Concepts: Bitwise operations, File handling, Pointers

7. Applications
- Secure communication
- Digital watermarking
- Cybersecurity learning

8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates secure data hiding using LSB steganography in C.
