# Image-Steganography-in-C
A C-based Image Steganography project that securely hides and extracts secret messages within digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The project demonstrates core concepts of data hiding, file handling, bitwise operations, and memory management in C, with a focus on secure and efficient information embedding and retrieval.
